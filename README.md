# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-using-Naive-Bayes

Background

1. Most common invasive cancer in women 
2. Second leading cause of cancer death in women after lung cancer
3. 1 in 8 women in the united states will develop breast cancer in her lifetime
4. Female breast cancer represents 15.2% of all new cancer in the U.S

Analysis

•	Early diagnosis of the cancer treatment is critical for successful treatment and hence this project explores the applicability of ML techniques.
•	Objective was to build a model to automatically detect breast cancer tumors
•	Observed and identified features which helps in identifying the parameters of the model
•	Successful in building a classification model to detect cancerous cells with decent accuracy
